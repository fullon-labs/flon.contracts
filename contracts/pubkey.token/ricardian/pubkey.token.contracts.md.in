The token manager agrees to issue {{quantity}} into circulation, and transfer it into {{to}}’s account.

{{#if memo}}There is a memo attached to the transfer stating:
{{memo}}
{{/if}}

If {{to}} does not have a balance for {{asset_to_symbol_code quantity}}, or the token manager does not have a balance for {{asset_to_symbol_code quantity}}, the token manager will be designated as the RAM payer of the {{asset_to_symbol_code quantity}} token balance for {{to}}. As a result, RAM will be deducted from the token manager’s resources to create the necessary records.

This action does not allow the total quantity to exceed the max allowed supply of the token.
